<h1>Our Vision</h1>
<p>Throughout history, God has sent to humanity a series of divine Educators—known as Manifestations of God—whose teachings have provided the basis for the advancement of civilization. These Manifestations have included Abraham, Krishna, Zoroaster, Moses, Buddha, Jesus, and Muhammad. Bahá’u’lláh, the latest of these Messengers, explained that the religions of the world come from the same Source and are in essence successive chapters of one religion from God.</p>
    <p>Bahá’ís believe the crucial need facing humanity is to find a unifying vision of the future of society and of the nature and purpose of life. Such a vision unfolds in the <a href="https://www.bahai.org/library/">writings of Bahá’u’lláh</a>.</p>

    <h1>What Bahá’ís Believe</h1>
    <p>In thousands upon thousands of locations around the world, the teachings of the Bahá’í Faith inspire individuals and communities as they work to improve their own lives and contribute to the advancement of civilization. Bahá’í beliefs address such essential themes as the oneness of God and religion, the oneness of humanity and freedom from prejudice, the inherent nobility of the human being, the progressive revelation of religious truth, the development of spiritual qualities, the integration of worship and service, the fundamental equality of the sexes, the harmony between religion and science, the centrality of justice to all human endeavours, the importance of education, and the dynamics of the relationships that are to bind together individuals, communities, and institutions as humanity advances towards its collective maturity.<sup>[2]</sup></p>

<h1>What Bahá’ís Do</h1>
<p>Since the inception of the Bahá’í Faith in the Nineteenth Century, a growing number of people have found in the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh a compelling vision of a better world. Many have drawn insights from these teachings—for example, on the oneness of humanity, on the equality of women and men, on the elimination of prejudice, on the harmony of science and religion—and have sought to apply Bahá’í principles to their lives and work. Others have gone further and have decided to join the Bahá’í community and participate in its efforts to contribute directly to the realization of Bahá’u’lláh’s stupendous vision for humanity’s coming of age.</p>

<p>Bahá’ís hail from all walks of life. Young and old, men and women alike, they live alongside others in every land and belong to every nation. They share a common goal of serving humanity and refining their inner-lives in accordance with the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh. The community to which they belong is one of learning and action, free from any sense of superiority or claim to exclusive understanding of truth. It is a community that strives to cultivate hope for the future of humanity, to foster purposeful effort, and to celebrate the endeavours of all those in the world who work to promote unity and alleviate human suffering.<sup>[3]</sup></p>

<h1>Involvement in the Life of Society</h1>
    <p>Bahá’u’lláh counselled His followers: “Be anxiously concerned with the needs of the age ye live in, and centre your deliberations on its exigencies and requirements.”</p>

    <p>As such, Bahá’ís throughout the world—both individually and collectively—strive to become involved in the life of society, working shoulder to shoulder with divers groups to contribute to the advancement of material and spiritual civilization.</p>

    <h1>Building Community</h1>
<!--<p>At this moment Baha’is are learning to address the crucial needs of our comunities:</p>-->
<!--<ul>-->
<!--    <li>Build united and prosperous communities throughout the planet (spiritual enterprise) that will “remedy the ills of [our] nation”</li>-->
<!--    <li>Accelerate the process of individual and community transformation</li>-->
<!--    <li>Empower individuals to change their families and communities</li>-->
<!--    <li>Promote race unity in the context of community building, social action, and involvement in the discourses of society</li>-->
<!--</ul>-->
    <p>Throughout the world those inspired by Baha’u’llah’s vision for a new world, are engaged in service to humanity.  They arrange activities and programs to build vibrant communities that are spiritually and materially prosperous. Raising such communities will require a tremendous increase in the capacity and maturity of the individuals, the institutions and the communities who will be its builders. At present, in Baha’i communities throughout  the region, such capacities are being fostered through activities and programs that revolve around the axis of worship and service.</p>

    <p>Through sharing insights from the Baha’i teachings with others, creating spaces for collective worship, empowering young people, and assisting groups of friends to study the word of God and apply it for the betterment of the world, participants contribute to a process of community building in which acts of worship and efforts to promote the common good are woven together.</p>

<!--    <blockquote><i>“And among the teachings of Bahá’u’lláh is that although material civilization is one of the means for the progress of the world of mankind, yet until it becomes combined with Divine civilization, the desired result, which is the felicity of mankind, will not be attained…”</i>  —‘Abdu’l-Bahá</blockquote>-->

<!--    -->
<!--<p>All are invited to join us in our efforts to build prosperous communities by infusing our community with the spirit of devotion, providing spiritual education for children and young adults, and developing capacity for service to humanity.</p>-->

<!--    <blockquote style="font-style: italic">-->
<!--        <p>-->
<!--        “Ultimately, then, the purpose of the training institute is to build the capacity of individuals to meet the many needs of growing, vibrant communities.”-->

<!--    <p>— The Universal House of Justice, Turning Point</p>-->

<!--        </p>-->
<!--    </blockquote>-->

<!--    <p>The focus of the Training Institute is on promoting the betterment of the world. It seeks to raise those who, while striving for individual spiritual and intellectual excellence, work to help their communities progress both materially and spiritually. The educational materials it offers draw on the transformative teachings of Bahá’u’lláh’s Revelation and the growing experience of the Bahá’í community in working to advance civilization. The Institute is not just for Bahá’is and their friends, but for anyone who has a desire to help their community and is motivated to work toward the vision of the oneness of mankind.</p>-->
