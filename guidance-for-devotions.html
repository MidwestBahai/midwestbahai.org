        <h3 class="has-text-align-center">Guidance from Bahá’í Teachings</h3>



        <h4 class="has-text-align-center">1.</h4>



        <p>The Twin Luminaries of this resplendent age have taught us this: Prayer is the essential spiritual conversation of the soul with its Maker, direct and without intermediation. It is the spiritual food that sustains the life of the spirit. Like the morning’s dew, it brings freshness to the heart and cleanses it, purifying it from attachments of the insistent self. It is a fire that burns away the veils and a light that leads to the ocean of reunion with the Almighty. On its wings does the soul soar in the heavens of God and draw closer to the divine reality. Upon its quality depends the development of the limitless capacities of the soul and the attraction of the bounties of God, but the prolongation of prayer is not desirable. The powers latent in prayer are manifested when it is motivated by the love of God, beyond any fear or&nbsp;favour, and free from ostentation and superstition. It is to be expressed with a sincere and pure heart conducive to contemplation and meditation so that the rational faculty can be illumined by its effects. Such prayer will transcend the limitation of words and go well beyond mere sounds. The sweetness of its melodies must gladden and uplift the heart and reinforce the penetrating power of the Word, transmuting earthly inclinations into heavenly attributes and inspiring selfless service to humankind.</p>



        <p class="has-text-align-right has-small-font-size">Universal House of Justice, 18 December 2014, to the Baha’is of Iran</p>



        <h4 class="has-text-align-center">2.</h4>



        <p>Teach your children the verses revealed from the heaven of majesty and power, so that, in most melodious tones, they may recite the Tablets of the All-Merciful in the alcoves within the&nbsp;Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs. Whoever hath been transported by the rapture born of adoration for My Name, the Most Compassionate, will recite the verses of God in such wise as to captivate the hearts of those yet wrapped in slumber. Well is it with him who hath quaffed the Mystic Wine of everlasting life from the utterance of his merciful Lord in My Name—a Name through which every lofty and majestic mountain hath been reduced to dust.</p>



        <p class="has-text-align-right has-small-font-size">Bahá’u’lláh, <em>The&nbsp;Kitáb-i-Aqdas</em></p>



        <h4 class="has-text-align-center">3.</h4>



        <p>The spiritual growth generated by individual devotions is reinforced by loving association among the friends in every locality, by worship as a community and by service to the Faith and to one’s fellow human beings. These communal aspects of the godly life relate to the law of the&nbsp;Mashriqu’l-Adhkár&nbsp;which appears in the&nbsp;Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Although the time has not come for the building of local&nbsp;Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs, the holding of regular meetings for worship open to all and the involvement of Bahá’í communities in projects of humanitarian service are expressions of this element of Bahá’í life and a further step in the implementation of the Law of God.&nbsp;</p>



        <p>It is our prayer at the Sacred Threshold that the greater attention to the spiritual&nbsp;heart of the Teachings which these laws express will enhance the devotion of the&nbsp;friends to the Source of all bounties and attract to the Cause the receptive souls&nbsp;among His spiritually famished children.&nbsp;</p>



        <p class="has-text-align-right has-small-font-size">Universal House of Justice, 28 December 1999, to the Bahá’ís of the World</p>



        <h4 class="has-text-align-center">4.</h4>



        <p>We have called upon the Bahá’ís to see in their endeavours of community building the creation of a new pattern of how society can be. Taken in its entirety, that pattern fosters capacity for service—for the education of young generations, for the empowerment of the youth, for the spiritual education of children, for the enhancement of the capacity to draw upon the influence of the Word of God in accompanying others into the field of service, and for the social and economic advancement of a people in the light of the divine teachings for the age. Essential to that pattern is the devotional meeting—a communal aspect of the godly life and a dimension of the concept of the&nbsp;Mashriqu’l-Adhkár—which represents a&nbsp;marvellous&nbsp;opportunity for your community not only to worship the Almighty and seek His benedictions in your own lives, but to extend to your fellow citizens the spiritual energies of prayer, to restore for them the purity of worship, to kindle in their hearts faith in the confirmations of God, and to strengthen in them, no less than in yourselves, eagerness to serve the nation and humanity and to show constructive resilience in the path of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



        <p>Beloved friends: Gatherings dedicated to prayer throughout your blessed land, in&nbsp;every&nbsp;neighbourhood, town, village, and hamlet, and the increasing access that&nbsp;your compatriots are gaining to Bahá’í prayers are enabling your community to&nbsp;shine the light of unity in the assemblage of humanity, lending a share to the&nbsp;endeavours&nbsp;of your fellow believers throughout the world. Plant, then, the seeds&nbsp;of future&nbsp;Mashriqu’l-Adhkárs&nbsp;for the benefit of all, and ignite countless beacons&nbsp;of light against the gloom of hatred and inequity.&nbsp;</p>



        <p class="has-text-align-right has-small-font-size">Universal House of Justice, 18 December 2014, to the Bahá’ís of Iran</p>



        <h4 class="has-text-align-center">5.</h4>



        <p>The systematic pursuit of the Plan in all its dimensions gives rise to a pattern of collective&nbsp;endeavour&nbsp;distinguished not only for its commitment to service, but also for its attraction to worship. The intensification of activity which the next five years requires will further enrich the devotional life shared by those who serve side by side in clusters around the world. This process of enrichment is already much advanced: witness, for instance, how gatherings for worship have been integrated into the core of community life. Devotional meetings are occasions where any soul may enter, inhale the heavenly fragrances, experience the sweetness of prayer, meditate upon the Creative Word, be transported on the wings of the spirit, and commune with the one Beloved. Feelings of fellowship and common cause are generated, particularly in the spiritually heightened conversations that naturally occur at such times and through which the “city of the human heart” may be opened. By convening a gathering for worship at which adults and children of any background are welcome, the spirit of the&nbsp;Másh̲riqu’l-Ádh̲kár&nbsp;is evoked in any locality. The enhancement of the devotional character of a community also has an effect on the Nineteen Day Feast and can be felt at other times when the friends come together.&nbsp;</p>



        <p class="has-text-align-right has-small-font-size">Universal House of Justice,&nbsp;29 December 2015,<br>to the Conference of the Continental Boards of&nbsp;Counsellors</p>



        <h4 class="has-text-align-center">6.</h4>



        <p>That the institutions of the Faith at all levels—from the local and the regional, to the national and the continental—are able to manage such growing complexity with greater and greater dexterity is both a sign and a necessity of their steady maturation. Evolving relationships among administrative structures have brought the Local Spiritual Assembly to the threshold of a new stage in the exercise of its responsibilities to diffuse the Word of God, to mobilize the energies of the believers, and to forge an environment that is spiritually edifying. On previous occasions we have explained that the maturity of a Spiritual Assembly cannot be assessed by the regularity of its meetings and the efficiency of its functioning alone. Rather its strength must be measured, to a large extent, by the vitality of the spiritual and social life of the community it serves—a growing community that welcomes the constructive contributions of both those who are formally enrolled and those who are not. It is gratifying to see that current approaches, methods and instruments are providing the means for Local Spiritual Assemblies, even those newly formed, to fulfill&nbsp;these responsibilities as they set about to ensure that the requirements of the Five Year Plan are adequately met in their localities. Indeed, the Assembly’s proper involvement with the Plan becomes crucial to every attempt to embrace large numbers—itself a requisite for the manifestation of the full range of its powers and capacities.</p>

        <h4 class="has-text-align-center">7.</h4>



        <p>Ye beloved of God! Behold how abundant shall be the freshness, tenderness, spirituality, and radiance that are attained when ye assemble in that gathering place of the spirit, occupy yourselves at dawn with the remembrance of God, and, after reciting prayers, make mention together of the Most Bountiful Lord in sweet melodies. These melodies shall reach unto the Kingdom of Glory, and these songs shall cheer and gladden the Concourse on high.</p>
