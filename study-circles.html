    <h1>Ruhi Courses: Youth Ages 15-20, Adults 21+</h1>
    <p>“… the Institute’s main sequence of courses is not arranged according to a series of subject matters, with the specific aim of increasing individual knowledge. The content and order are based, rather, on a series of acts of service, the practice of which creates capacity in the individual to meet the exigencies of dynamic, developing communities. And as also noted above, the enhancement of such capacity is viewed in terms of ‘walking a path of service’.”</p>

        <p>        — Ruhi.org</p>

    <img src="study-circles.jpg"/>

    <p>With the assistance of a tutor, the courses of the Institute are studied in local groups called “study circles.” The courses aim at raising understanding of spiritual matters and building the capacity to offer various acts of service to the local community. Among the acts of service are hosting gatherings for prayers, teaching children’s classes, serving as an animator of junior youth groups, or tutoring Ruhi courses. By focusing on developing capacity for service, the individuals studying the courses tend their own growth as well as their community’s growth.</p>

<!--<h2>Study Circles for Personal and Community Transformation</h2>-->


<!--            <p>The Bahá’í teachings emphasize that each person is in charge of his or her own spiritual development. While institutions exist to guide and release energies, and Bahá’í community life is to be characterized by an atmosphere of cordial consultation and encouragement, the responsibility for spiritual growth ultimately rests with each individual. Indeed, there is no clergy in the Bahá’í Faith; the Bahá’í community can neither be described in terms of a pastor and congregation, nor as that of a body of believers led by learned individuals endowed with authority to interpret scriptures.</p>-->

<!--            <p>To build a better world requires an ever-growing pool of people capable of contributing to the accomplishment of the myriad tasks at hand.</p>-->

<!--            <p>We may think of the work of the training institute, then, as maintaining a system of distance education to fuel and facilitate this evolving conversation. The principal elements of the system include the “study circle”, the tutor, and a set of materials, grounded in the Bahá’í writings, that express the spiritual insights and the knowledge gained in the process of translating Bahá’u’lláh’s teachings into reality. The materials help the individual enter into the discussion of what the Bahá’í community has learned through experience as it has tried to contribute to the advancement of civilization. More crucially, they seek to involve him or her in this process of learning and in the diffusion of relevant knowledge.</p>-->
